Hi there 👋🏻 welcome to my GitHub! I’m someone who loves digging into tough problems, and I’m currently shifting gears from Computational Physics—where I got hooked on coding and messing around with AI simulations—to Cybersecurity. I’m chasing a gig as a Cybersecurity Analyst, excited to use my knack for breaking things down, plus some fresh skills, to lock down systems and outsmart threats. For me, it’s all about keeping things real: learning by doing, rolling up my sleeves, and tackling the messy stuff head-on. Let’s make something cool happen! 🚀

Cheers!!
